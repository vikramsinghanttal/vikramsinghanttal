# Hi, I'm Vikram 👋🏾 👩🏾‍💻


I am a research engineer passionate about building and contributing to tools and packages in AI, wireless communication, signal processing, and quantum computing. My goal is to make learning easier, create technology that elevates people, and foster community development. I have built a Python-based simulation package called <a href="https://gigayasawireless.github.io/toolkit5G/">5G-Toolkit</a>, which is used for simulating 5th and 6th Generation Wireless Networks. I am currently developing GPU-accelerated open-source tools for simulating communication networks, information theory, and signal processing. These projects are in their early stages. If you're interested in contributing, please feel free to reach out. The initial versions of the tools will be available in the second quarter of 2025.
