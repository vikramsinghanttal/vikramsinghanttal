I am a research engineer passionate about building and contributing to tools and packages in AI, wireless communication, signal processing, and quantum computing. My goal is to make learning quicker and easier, create technology that simplifies the lives of people. I have built a Python-based simulation package called <a href="https://gigayasawireless.github.io/toolkit5G/">5G-Toolkit</a>, which is used for simulating 5th and 6th Generation Wireless Networks. I am currently developing GPU-accelerated open-source tools for simulating:

- Communication Systems (<a href="https://github.com/vikramsinghanttal/Communication-System-Toolkit">toolkitComm</a>.),
- Information Theory and Coding Theory (<a href="https://github.com/vikramsinghanttal/Information-and-Coding-Theory-Toolkit">toolkitITC</a>), and
- Signal Processing (<a href="https://github.com/vikramsinghanttal/Signal-Processing-Toolkit">toolkitSigProc</a>).

These projects are in their early stages. If you're interested in contributing, please feel free to reach out. The initial versions of the tools will be available in the second quarter of 2025.
