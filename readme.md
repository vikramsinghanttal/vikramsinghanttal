I am a research engineer passionate about developing and contributing to tools and packages in AI, wireless communication, signal processing, and quantum computing. My goal is to accelerate learning, create technologies that simplify people's lives, and contribute to advancements in these fields.

I have developed a Python-based simulation package called [5G-Toolkit](https://gigayasawireless.github.io/toolkit5G/), which is used to simulate 5th and 6th Generation Wireless Networks. Currently, I am working on GPU-accelerated, open-source tools for simulating:

- Communication Systems ([toolkitComm](https://github.com/vikramsinghanttal/Communication-System-Toolkit)),
- Information Theory and Coding Theory ([toolkitITC](https://github.com/vikramsinghanttal/Information-and-Coding-Theory-Toolkit)), and
- Signal Processing ([toolkitSigProc](https://github.com/vikramsinghanttal/Signal-Processing-Toolkit)).

These projects are still in the early stages. If you're interested in contributing, feel free to reach out. The initial versions of the tools are expected to be available in the second quarter of 2025.

This version tightens up the language and improves the flow while keeping all the essential details intact. Let me know if you'd like any further adjustments!
